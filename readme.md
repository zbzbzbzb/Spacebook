I regularly committed my changes to github and I used my organisations commit style to structure my commit messages
wip : work in progress
feat : feature
refactor : means code changes that dont affect how it runs
fix : fixing an error or bug

Using eslint i followed the google code style, i was able to use the Visual Studio Code plugin to monitor my code while I was writing it
